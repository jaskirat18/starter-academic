I received my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2020. I worked as an analog design intern for three months in summer 2019 in the I/O design team at Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India.

I am currently working as an analog design engineer in the IP development team at Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India. My research interests lie in power amplifiers, RF/mm-wave integrated circuits, and analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits. I have enjoyed working in the field of circuits for both industry projects and academic research.
