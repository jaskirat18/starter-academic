I am an analog design engineer in the Analog NVM team at Texas Instruments (TI), Bangalore, India. My research interests lie in RF/mm-wave IC, power amplifiers, and analog/mixed-signal IC. I joined TI in July 2020 and have been working in the NVM team since then. My team designs non-volatile memory IPs for TI. My responsibility includes designing oscillators and other peripheral circuits for the NVM IPs. Before joining full-time, I also did a 10-week summer internship in the I/O team at TI in 2019. My internship project was to design a high-speed bi-directional GPIO circuit for multiple I/O voltage domains.

I received my BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2020. I worked on several projects related to ECE during my undergraduate years. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with Prof. Bishnu Prasad Das of IIT Roorkee and designed a low-power CMOS ECG sensor for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases. I have enjoyed working in the field of circuits for both industry projects and academic research.

Beginning Fall 2021, I will be joining the Integrated Sensors Laboratory (ISL) at UCLA as a Ph.D. student. I will be working on high-frequency IC under the supervision of Prof. Aydin Babakhani. I have also been awarded a Department Fellowship from UCLA ECE.
