I am an incoming graduate student at UCLA Integrated Sensors Laboratory. I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, focusing on high-frequency integrated circuits. My research interests lie in RF/mm-wave IC, power amplifiers, and analog/mixed-signal IC. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. Aydin Babakhani. I have been awarded a Department Fellowship from UCLA ECE.

I received my BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2020. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with Prof. Bishnu Prasad Das of IIT Roorkee and designed a low-power CMOS ECG sensor for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases. 
I worked as an analog design engineer in the ATD Memory team at Texas Instruments (Bangalore, India) from July 2020 to August 2021. My team designed non-volatile memory IPs for TI. During this time, I designed oscillators and other peripheral circuits for the NVM IPs. Before joining full-time, I also did a summer internship in the I/O team at TI in 2019. My internship project was to design a high-speed bi-directional GPIO circuit for multiple I/O voltage domains. I have enjoyed working in the field of circuits for both industry projects and academic research.
