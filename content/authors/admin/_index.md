I am an analog design engineer in the IP development team at Texas Instruments Incorporated. My research interests include power amplifiers, Radio Frequency IC, mm-wave circuits, communication circuits, and analog/mixed-signal IC. I received my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in July 2020. Before joining as a full-time employee at TI, I interned with the I/O design team at TI in the summers of 2019.
